# V2V-safety-Network
The V2V Safety Network is a built-in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications system that is intended to improve roadway safety through real-time data exchange and smart detection modules. The project is comprised of three key elements:

DiversionCation: Identifies and warns for abrupt vehicle detours or lane changes to avoid side crashes and enhance situation awareness among all the linked vehicles.

SleepingDetechtion: Tracks the driver's behavior to detect symptoms of drowsiness or microsleep events, providing early warnings to minimize the risk of fatigue-related accidents.

VechileDetection: Employs sophisticated perception algorithms to detect surrounding vehicles and possible hazards, even under difficult conditions like occlusions or low visibility, by pooling data from multiple vehicles in the network.

By integrating these modules, the V2V Safety Network allows cars to transmit and receive vital safety messages . By working together, vehicles can "see" beyond their own sensor and give early warnings to driversâ€”ultimately preventing collision risks and enhancing overall traffic safety.
